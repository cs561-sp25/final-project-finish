# CS 561 Final Project "After" Repository

This repository contains the target finishing state of the CS 561 final project repository.

The `main` branch of your team's final repository will closely match this one, with notable exceptions:
- This `README.md` file will be replaced with a new one that contains the final project report.
- The `tests` folder will contain your final test suites
- Your final code may include improvemets, as documented in the `README.md` files of your repository's feature branches.
